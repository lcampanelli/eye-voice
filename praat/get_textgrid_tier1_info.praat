# This script goes through all TextGrid files in the specified directory, 
# it saves in a csv file various info about intervals in tier 1
# creates TextGrid files in the subdirectory "textgrid" (which must be already created), 
# calculates total duration of each sound file, 
# calculates the duration of the first X interval(s) [interval 1 = onset], 
# saves results to a *.csv file.
